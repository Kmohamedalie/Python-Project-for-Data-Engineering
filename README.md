### **Practice Project Scenario:** <br>
An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their [GDPs in billion USDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)) (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.
